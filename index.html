    <p class="para">The biggest reason we give flowers as gifts is to connect with an emotion. Whether its love, joy, affection, appreciation, sympathy, romance or apologies; flower giving communicates the deepest feelings in the most elegant manner. Yellow and orange flowers signify mean joy of life, blue means freedom, and pink conveys sweeter emotions or intimacy. ... A bunch of pink flowers is the symbol of youth and expresses a love that is newborn. Pink flowers are associated with a happy event like a wedding and also represent admiration.</p>
